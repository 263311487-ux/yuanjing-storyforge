description: "Yuanjing Storyforge (元境·漫界工坊), formerly ai-comic-drama, is a manifest-first Agent Skill for comic-drama production: shot planning, provider-neutral generation plans, cost gates, subtitles, assembly, technical QA, and auditable human review. Use when turning a script or shot list into a reproducible comic-drama production workflow; paid provider execution remains explicit opt-in."

Read README.md for executable commands and current limitations. Develop an approved script into shots with purpose, visible action, camera, dialogue and end state. Preserve the user's genre, duration, language and audio preferences.

Run scripts/validate_manifest.py on the example contract. Use scripts/run_mock.py to exercise the offline resumable runner and budget gates. Use scripts/seedance_plan.py only to inspect an explicit Seedance command; the plan script rejects `--execute` and never submits. Use scripts/make_srt.py and scripts/assemble_plan.py for provider-neutral subtitle and assembly planning. Use scripts/previz.py for a text storyboard, scripts/estimate_cost.py for per-second cost estimates, and scripts/qa_report.py for an unreviewed checklist. These commands do not invoke providers.

For a first successful offline run, use `python3 scripts/quickstart.py`. It writes a reproducible artifact index under `work/quickstart/` without contacting a paid provider.
For a new episode, start with `python3 scripts/init_manifest.py --out work/episode.json --title "..."`, fill the required fields, then validate.
If installation is uncertain, run `python3 scripts/doctor.py`; it reports offline readiness and optional encoder/provider CLI availability without making paid calls.
Use `python3 scripts/validate_manifest.py <manifest> --strict` before a production handoff to require release metadata and complete shot fields.
Use `python3 scripts/manifest_report.py <manifest>` to summarize duration, dialogue, assets, provider, and budget before generation.
Use `python3 scripts/continuity_check.py <manifest> --json` to catch broken shot links and unknown asset references before generation.
Read `references/manifest-schema.md` when converting an existing script or legacy manifest into the public contract.

Keyword checks cannot certify compliance. Unreviewed reports cannot certify content. Legacy narrative, technical and delivery scripts remain experimental and are not integrated with this example schema. Never describe this skill as an end-to-end generator or declare content publishable based on a successful command.

The offline MockProvider and resumable runner are implemented in `ai_comic_drama/`. Real provider adapters remain opt-in and must follow references/providers.md. Seedance CLI calls have bounded timeouts; an ambiguous submission is recorded as `unknown` and is never automatically retried, to avoid duplicate paid work.

Publish approval binds the content report and every required release asset explicitly passed with `approve_publish.py --file`; delivery rejects missing or changed video, manifest, and subtitle hashes. Reviewer/publisher names are self-reported, not authenticated. Real publication still requires external identity and platform-compliance controls. The Seedance adapter has not been verified in a real paid run; the documented legacy audio mode is not production-validated.
